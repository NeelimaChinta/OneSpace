# Social Networking Website
This is a social media platform for software developers and programmers of all skill levels to connect and interact with one another.

## Motivation
At my most recent co-op, the team I worked on was using a MERN JavaScript development stack. As I was relatively new to software development, I wanted to do a project (similar to what I was working with at my co-op placement) to help get introduced to web development.
